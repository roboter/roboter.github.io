# Roboter Astro Theme

This repository contains the **ev0-astro-theme**, a modern, premium‑looking blog template built with **Astro**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React** integration. The site showcases:

- A clean, dark‑mode ready design with smooth micro‑animations.
- Support for **Lottie** animations via `react-lottie`.
- SEO‑friendly meta tags, Open Graph data, and a sitemap.
- Automatic PWA support powered by `vite-plugin-pwa`.
- Easy content management using Markdown and Astro components.

The theme is fully configurable via `astro.config.mjs` and includes integrations for compression, sitemap generation, and Tailwind utilities. It is ready to be deployed to any static‑hosting platform.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies (using Yarn)
yarn install

# Run the development server
yarn dev
```

Feel free to customize the theme, add your own pages, and extend it with additional Astro integrations.
